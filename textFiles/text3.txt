Specific false memories can sometimes be shared by a large group of people. This phenomenon was dubbed the "Mandela effect" by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, who reported having vivid and detailed memories of news coverage of South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s, despite Mandela actually dying in 2013, decades after his release and after serving as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. Broome reported that hundreds of other people had written about having the same memory of Mandela's death,[13] some while he was still alive, and she speculated that the phenomenon could be evidence of parallel realities.[14]


The Bologna station clock in Italy, subject of a collective false memory
One well-documented example of shared false memories comes from a 2010 study that examined people familiar with the clock at Bologna Centrale railway station, which was damaged in a bombing in August 1980. In the study, 92% of respondents falsely remembered the clock had remained stopped since the bombing, when, in fact, the clock was repaired shortly after the attack. Years later, the clock was again stopped and set to the time of the explosion, in observance and commemoration of the bombing.[15]

Other examples include memories of the respective title component of the Berenstain Bears children's books being spelled "Berenstein",[16][17] the logo of clothing brand Fruit of the Loom featuring a cornucopia,[18] Darth Vader telling Luke Skywalker, "Luke, I am your father" in the climax of The Empire Strikes Back (he actually says, "No, I am your father" in response to Skywalker's assertion that Vader killed his father),[19] Mr. Monopoly wearing a monocle,[20][21][22] and the existence of a 1990s movie titled Shazaam starring comedian Sinbad as a genie[23] (which Snopes suggests could be a confabulation of real memories, possibly including Sinbad wearing a genie-like costume during a TV marathon of Sinbad the Sailor movies in 1994,[24][25] the 1996 film Kazaam featuring a genie played by basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, and the 1960s animated genie-themed series Shazzan).[23][26] Likewise, false memories of Mandela's death could be explained as the subject conflating him with Steve Biko, another prominent South African anti-apartheid activist, who died in prison in 1977.[27][28][29]
