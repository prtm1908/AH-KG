"Lead and zinc are essential metals used in various industries, and their production can be achieved through different methods depending on the type of ore utilized. In pyrometallurgical processes, the ore concentrate containing lead and zinc is fed into a primary smelter after undergoing sintering in some cases. The lead concentration in ores can range from 50% to 70%, while zinc concentration falls within 40% to 60%. During sintering, hot air or oxygen is used to oxidize the sulfur present in the feed, resulting in sulfur dioxide. Traditional reduction and refining methods involve blast furnaces, but modern processes like QSL, Kivcet, AUSMELT, and TBRC have been introduced. In primary lead processing, a series of steps is followed. A feedstock primarily composed of lead concentrate is fed into a sintering machine, along with other raw materials. The sintering feed and coke are then introduced into a blast furnace for reducing and smelting the lead-containing materials. The molten lead settles at the bottom of the furnace, forming different layers that are subsequently drained off. After drossing, where impurities are removed, the lead bullion undergoes several refining stages to eliminate remaining non-lead materials. This pyrometallurgical process results in lead with a purity of 99.90% to 99.99%, which can be used directly or combined with other metals to form alloys.",What are the typical lead concentrations in ores used for pyrometallurgical processing?,How is sulfur dioxide produced during the sintering process in lead production?,What is the purity range of lead achieved through pyrometallurgical refining?,Lead concentrations in ores used for pyrometallurgical processing can range from 50% to 70%.,Sulfur dioxide is produced during the sintering process when hot air or oxygen is used to oxidize the sulfur present in the feed.,"Through pyrometallurgical refining, lead purity ranges from 99.90% to 99.99%.","zinc -> ARE -> use | 1.0
